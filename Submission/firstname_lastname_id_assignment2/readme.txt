4. Contribution Summary

Chinmay Rane : 
Worked on implementing Q-learning with Omkar to solve the snake game.
Demonstrated the Q-learning agent in action in the demo video for the presentation.
Added the Introduction and related work in the report.
Explained the Qlearning in depth in the report.
Added the References in the report.


Omkar Padir: 
Worked on implementing Q-learning with Chinmay to solve the snake game.
Generated evaluation numbers for 100 episodes by counting the number of steps taken and food eaten each time.
Collated evaluation numbers for all algorithms and created box plots for food eaten and number of snake moves. Added evaluation between all 4 algorithms in the report.
Added and presented the slides for Qlearning and Evaluation in the presentation.


Pratush Pandita: 
Since the open-gym env is suitable for only RL environments, added the boiler plate code to apply other Non-RL algorithms like BFS, Hamilton and Genetic.
Implemented the hamilton and BFS logic in the code to solve the snake game.
Helped in writing the forward checking logic for A* algorithm to solve the snake game.
Generated evaluation numbers for hamilton path and BFS by running the algorithm 100 times and counting the number of steps taken and food eaten each time.
Demonstrated the BFS in action in the demo video in the presentation.


Udisha Chaudhary: 
Implemented A* with forward checking to solve the snake game.
Generated evaluation numbers for A* by running the algorithm 100 times and counting the number of steps taken and food eaten each time.
Added explanations of the approach for BFS, Hamilton and A* with forward checking in the report.
Added Problem Definition and Future Work in the report.
Demonstrated the A star with forward checking in action in the demo video for the presentation.


Pratik
Worked on implementing the Genetic algorithm to solve the snake game.
Generated evaluation numbers for Genetic algorithm by running the algorithm for 100 generations and counting the number of steps taken and food eaten each time.
Added explanations related to Genetic algorithm in the report
Demonstrated the genetic algorithm in action in the demo video for the presentation.
